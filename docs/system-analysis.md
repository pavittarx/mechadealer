## System Analysis

### Identification of Need
The need of an automated trading arises from following factors --
1. Due to manual nature of current trading activity, the firm misses out on utilising strategies that could generate profit.
2. The firm is not able to monitor the performance of its trading strategies on a real-time basis.
3. There is a heavy dependency on human discretion and manual intervention to allocate funds to specific strategies and adjust investments.
4. The firm is not able to make optimal use of its resources, as it is dependent on human intervention.
